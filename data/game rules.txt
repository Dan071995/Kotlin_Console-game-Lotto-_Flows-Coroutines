                             ~~ Rules of the game ~~
The game involves 2 players. Each player is given the same number of game cards (from 1 to 3).
The game card has 3 rows and 9 columns. There are 15 numbers on the game card. The host calls
the number and the goal of each player is to mark this number on his playing field. When one
of the players completely fills at least one playing field, the game ends.
