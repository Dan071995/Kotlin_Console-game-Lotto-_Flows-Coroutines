# Kotlin_Console-game-Lotto_Flows-Coroutines

90 barrels take part in the game. Each barrel has a number on it. All kegs are placed in a special opaque bag and mixed before the start of the game.
The game card consists of three lines, each of them has nine cells, five of which are numbers. Empty cells are not intended for the game. Numbers on one card cannot be repeated.
Each of the players takes one or more cards for himself, and the number of playing cards for each of the players must be the same.
The host takes one of the barrels out of the bag. Each player checks if there is such a number on his game cards. If the announced leading number is on the game card, the player closes it with a special marker. If there is no such number, then the player waits for the announcement of the next number.

Kegs are taken until one of the players fills at least one of their cards!
